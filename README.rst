=====

General Billy is/will be a generalization of `Sunlight Labs' <sunlightlabs.org>`_ `billy <https://github.com/sunlightlabs/billy>`_, a suite of tools developed as a part of `Open States <http://openstates.org>`_ that provide a framework for scraping, storing, and sharing legislative information. The idea here is to generalize that to be potentially useful in ANY situation where:

#) a group of individuals are engaged in creating and codifying rules or proclamations; and
#) the individuals are accountable for their published decisions and actions in this process. 

billy features:
    * Scraper architecture for scraping bills, votes, legislators, committees, and events.
    * Utility scripts for data cleanup and analysis.
    * Bulk data export.
    * Server that includes a data browser and API.
