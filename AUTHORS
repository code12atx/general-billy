General Billy was conceived during Codeathon ATX 2012 by
Steven Collins <stevencollins@acm.org>. Much thanks for this conception are
due to Silona Bonewald, whose idea for an opencities project was the catalyst
for this, and to the tech folks at Blue Goji Games <http://www.bluegoji.com>
for motivating me to work on my Python and MongoDB skills, which brought opencities
to my attention.
